# Supabase Notes (Legacy)

This file is retained for historical context.

For active setup and troubleshooting, use:

- [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)
- [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](./SUPABASE_SETUP.md)

## Current source of truth

- Database connectivity: `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
- Schema sync: `npm run db:push`
- Server start: `npm run dev`

## Why this file is minimal now

Earlier versions duplicated setup steps across multiple docs and referenced stale migration instructions. The canonical setup has been consolidated into the two docs above.
