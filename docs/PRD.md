# Product Requirements Document — Vantage

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2026
**Owner:** Travel Boutique Online (TBO)
**Platform:** Group Travel Management for MICE & Destination Weddings

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Group travel for MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) and destination weddings is still largely coordinated offline through emails, spreadsheets, and manual follow-ups. Vantage digitizes this complexity by introducing:

1. **Group Inventory Management** — Negotiated rates, protected allotments, inclusions, and validity mapped per event
2. **Event Microsite** — Branded per-event page where guests self-serve RSVPs and bookings
3. **TBO API Integration** — Live hotel and flight search replacing manual data entry

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Architecture

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express 5 (server-side proxy for all TBO API calls)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase + Drizzle ORM
- **Auth:** Session-based (express-session + connect-pg-simple)
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query v5)
- **Build:** Vite (client) + esbuild (server)

### 4.2 API Integration

- All TBO API calls MUST be server-side only — credentials never sent to browser
- TBO Air API token cached in memory with 55-minute TTL
- Graceful fallback to manual entry if TBO API unavailable
- Raw TBO responses stored in JSONB columns for forward compatibility

### 4.3 Security

- Guest portal: token-based (UUID access token in URL) — no password required
- Agent/Client: session-based with bcrypt-hashed passwords
- Ground team: session-based, scoped to specific event by agent
- Public microsite: returns only human-readable summaries — no PII, no TBO credentials, no booking codes

### 4.4 Non-Functional Requirements

- Mobile-responsive (critical for guests traveling and ground team on-site)
- Luxury design aesthetic: Champagne/Navy/Slate color palette
- Real-time capacity monitoring
- Bulk operations: import 500+ guests via Excel without timeout

---

## 5. Out of Scope (V1 MVP)

- Payment processing (Stripe/Razorpay integration)
- Email/SMS notification system
- WhatsApp integration for guest communication
- Train booking API (rail data)
- Multi-currency support
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards
- White-labeling for TBO partner agents
- Mobile native app (iOS/Android)

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### Full End-to-End Flow

1. Agent signs in → creates event → searches TBO hotel → blocks rooms → searches TBO flight → allocates seats
2. Agent sets up labels (VIP, Family) → assigns perks with expense toggles
3. Agent imports guest list → assigns labels → publishes event
4. Guest receives link → opens microsite → enters booking ref → lands in guest portal
5. Guest completes RSVP → views travel details → selects optional activities → confirms included perks
6. Ground team signs in → searches guest → marks arrived on check-in day
7. Agent views inventory dashboard → sees rooms blocked vs confirmed → downloads rooming list

### API Integration Criteria

- `GET /api/tbo/hotel/countries` returns live TBO country list
- `POST /api/tbo/hotel/search` returns available hotels for given city/dates
- `POST /api/tbo/hotel/book` returns a real `ConfirmationNumber` stored in DB
- `POST /api/tbo/flight/search` returns live flight results with `TraceId`
- `POST /api/tbo/flight/book` returns a real `PNR` stored in DB
