## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — check with `node -v`
- A **Supabase** project (free tier is fine) — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

### Setup steps

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/samyuktha2004/Vantage.git
cd Vantage
npm install

# 2. Create your .env file from the template
cp .env.example .env
# Then open .env and fill in your DATABASE_URL and SESSION_SECRET (see below)

# 3. Push the schema to your Supabase DB (run this once, and again after schema changes)
npm run db:push

# 4. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

The app runs at **http://localhost:5000** by default.

| OS | Default URL | Notes |
|----|-------------|-------|
| Windows / Linux | http://localhost:5000 | Works out of the box |
| macOS Monterey+ | http://localhost:5000 | ⚠️ May fail if AirPlay Receiver is on |

> **macOS AirPlay conflict:** macOS Monterey and later reserves port 5000 for AirPlay Receiver.
> If you see an error on startup, add `PORT=5001` to your `.env` and open http://localhost:5001 instead.
> To check: System Settings → General → AirDrop & Handoff → AirPlay Receiver.

---

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in these values:

| Variable | Where to find it | Required |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supabase → Settings → Database → Connection string → URI | Yes |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` | Yes (in prod) |
| `PORT` | Leave unset (default 5000). Set to `5001` only on macOS if AirPlay conflicts | No |
| `TBO_HOTEL_URL` | TBO B2B Holidays API base URL | For hotel search |
| `TBO_HOTEL_USERNAME` / `TBO_HOTEL_PASSWORD` | TBO Hackathon credentials | For hotel search |
| `TBO_AIR_URL` | TekTravels UAT endpoint | For flight search |
| `TBO_AIR_USERNAME` / `TBO_AIR_PASSWORD` | TBO Hackathon credentials | For flight search |
| `TBO_AIR_SERVER_IP` | Your server's public IP (use `127.0.0.1` for local) | For flight auth |

`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are **not required** — the app connects directly to Postgres via `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## How the Database Works

The project uses **Drizzle ORM** connected directly to **Supabase PostgreSQL**.

```
shared/schema.ts          ← Single source of truth for all tables and columns
      ↓
npm run db:push           ← Drizzle reads the schema and syncs it to Supabase
      ↓
server/db.ts              ← Creates a connection pool using DATABASE_URL
      ↓
server/storage.ts         ← All DB queries (wrapped in typed functions)
server/routes.ts          ← API handlers call storage functions
```

### Key points

- **`shared/schema.ts`** is where all tables are defined. If you add a column here, run `npm run db:push` to apply it to the live DB.
- **No migration files are used** — `db:push` applies changes directly. This is fast for development but skips the migration history. The `migrations/` folder is a stale artefact and can be ignored.
- **Session store is in-memory** (`MemoryStore`). Sessions are lost when the server restarts. For production, swap in `connect-pg-simple` to persist sessions in Postgres.
- **DB reset for demos**: Paste `supabase/migrations/002_clear_data.sql` into the Supabase SQL Editor to wipe all data and reset ID sequences.

### Drizzle cheat sheet

```bash
npm run db:push     # Apply schema changes to Supabase (run after editing shared/schema.ts)
npm run dev         # Start dev server (hot reload)
npm run build       # Build for production (output: dist/)
npm run start       # Run production build
```

## Deploying

### Free Hosting (Zero Cost Stack)

The entire project can be hosted for **free** using these services:

| Layer | Service | Free tier |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Database** | [Supabase](https://supabase.com) | 2 projects, 500 MB DB, always-on |
| **App hosting** | [Render](https://render.com) | 1 free web service, spins down after 15 min idle |
| **App hosting** | [Railway](https://railway.app) | $5 free credit/month, no spin-down |

**Supabase** is already set up (your `DATABASE_URL` points to it). You just need to host the app.

#### Render (no credit card required)

1. Push your code to GitHub (make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`)
2. [render.com](https://render.com) → New → Web Service → Connect your repo
3. Set these fields:
   - **Build command:** `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start command:** `npm run start`
   - **Node version:** 18 (set in Environment → `NODE_VERSION=18`)
4. Add your environment variables (same as your local `.env`)
5. Click **Deploy** — Render gives you a `.onrender.com` URL

> **Free tier note:** Render spins your service down after 15 minutes of no traffic. The first request after idle takes ~30 seconds to wake up. For a hackathon demo, open the URL 30s before you present.

#### Railway ($5 free credit/month — no spin-down)

1. Push to GitHub
2. [railway.app](https://railway.app) → New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Select your repo → Railway auto-detects Node.js
4. Add environment variables in the Railway dashboard
5. Your app is live on a `.railway.app` URL immediately

Railway runs persistently (no cold starts) and the free $5/month credit covers ~500 hours — more than enough for a project this size.

### Why not Vercel or Firebase?

**Vercel** runs serverless functions, not persistent Node.js servers. This app uses Express sessions (stateful) and an in-memory session store — both incompatible with serverless. You'd need to rewrite auth as stateless JWTs first.

**Firebase Hosting** only serves static files. The Express API would need to be rewritten as Cloud Functions — significant restructuring.

**Use Render or Railway instead** — they run regular Node.js servers and need zero configuration changes.

## User Roles

| Role | Access | Sign-in URL |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Agent** | Creates events, imports guests, manages all settings | `/auth/agent/signin` |
| **Client** | Views their event, edits label budgets, toggles perk coverage | `/auth/client/signin` |
| **Ground Team** | Check-in dashboard + rooming list, scoped to one event | `/auth/groundteam/signin` |
| **Guest** | Token-based URL — no login required | `/guest/:token` |

---

## Key User Flows

### Agent creates an event
```
Sign in → Dashboard "+ New Event" → EventSetup (hotel + flight via TBO) →
Labels tab (add tiers + budgets) → Perks tab → Import guests (CSV/XLSX) →
Publish → Copy invite link → Share with guests
```

### Guest RSVPs
```
Open microsite /event/:eventCode → Enter booking ref →
/guest/:token → RSVP + family → Travel prefs → Summary → Add-ons → Receipt
```

### Ground team checks in guests
```
Sign in → /groundteam/:id/checkin → Scan QR / search by name →
Mark Arrived → Update flight status → Walk-in registration if needed
```

### Client monitors the event
```
Sign in → Enter event code → ClientEventView →
Edit label budgets → Toggle perk coverage → View pending requests
```

## Tech Stack

### Full Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript | UI and state management |
| **Build tool** | Vite 5 | Fast HMR dev server, optimised production bundles |
| **Routing** | Wouter | Lightweight client-side router (no Next.js — pure SPA) |
| **Server state** | TanStack Query v5 | Async data fetching, caching, background refetch |
| **UI components** | shadcn/ui (Radix UI) | Accessible, unstyled primitives |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v3 | Utility-first, mobile-first responsive design |
| **Animation** | Framer Motion | Page transitions, waitlist promotion banner |
| **Backend** | Express 5 + TypeScript | REST API server |
| **Runtime** | Node.js 18+ (tsx for dev) | Single process: serves API + static SPA |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL via Supabase | Managed Postgres, no self-hosting needed |
| **ORM** | Drizzle ORM | Type-safe SQL, schema-first, no migration files in dev |
| **Auth** | bcryptjs + express-session | Cookie sessions for agents/clients; signed token URLs for guests |
| **APIs** | TBO Hotel B2B API, TBO Air (TekTravels UAT) | Live hotel and flight search with mock fallback |
| **Excel** | XLSX (SheetJS) | Guest list import (CSV/XLSX) + rooming-list export |
| **CSV** | Papaparse | Fast CSV parsing in browser |
| **QR** | html5-qrcode + qrcode | Ground team scan + per-guest QR generation |
| **PDF/Print** | Browser `window.print()` | Manifest export (no external lib needed) |

### Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **No Next.js** | The app uses Express sessions (stateful) + a persistent server. Next.js serverless functions don't support this without a major rewrite. |
| **No separate client/server ports** | Vite proxies `/api/*` to Express in dev; production serves the Vite bundle from the same Express process. One port, zero CORS issues. |
| **No real-time WebSocket** | Ground team dashboard polls every 30 s — sufficient for check-in latency without the overhead of WebSocket infra. |
| **Token URLs for guests** | Guests need zero login friction. A signed random UUID in the URL gives per-guest isolation without credentials. |
| **Drizzle `db:push` in dev** | Schema changes apply directly to Supabase without migration files. Fast for hackathon iteration. |
| **TBO mock fallback** | When TBO API credentials are unavailable (local dev, demo), the server returns realistic mock data so all guest flows work end-to-end. |

### Scalability

The same architecture runs a 50-guest boutique wedding or a 5,000-delegate convention:

- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL scales vertically (connection pooler available for high concurrency)
- **API**: Express stateless per-request — horizontal scaling behind a load balancer needs only session persistence (swap `MemoryStore` for `connect-pg-simple`)
- **Frontend**: Vite code-splits by route; TanStack Query aggressive caching means minimal server round-trips for repeat views
- **Ground team polling**: 30-second interval — fine for check-in volume of any event size

### Mobile-First Design

Every page is built mobile-first (Tailwind `sm:` / `md:` breakpoints):
- Guest portal: full flow works on a phone browser — no app download
- Ground team dashboard: tablet-optimised for scan + check-in at the door
- Agent dashboard: desktop-primary with responsive fallbacks

## USPs at a Glance

| USP | Where it works |
|-----|---------------|
| **Socially-Intelligent Waitlist** | Guest declines → server auto-promotes highest-priority waitlisted guest. Priority = label tier (VIP=1, Family=2, General=3). |
| **Budget-Cap Auto-Pilot** | `addOnBudget` per label. Server auto-approves requests within budget (no agent/client call). Client UI toggle shows "Auto-Pilot: ON". |
| **Smart Check gate** | Guest sees their name + event details before RSVP form — prevents wrong-link confusion. |
| **Conflict-Aware Itinerary** | Server rejects itinerary registration if two events overlap in time. Guest sees a clear conflict toast. |
| **Split Billing** | Each perk: `expenseHandledByClient` flag. "Included" = client pays. "₹X" = self-pay. Visible in guest add-ons. |
| **Bleisure Upsell** | Guest can extend hotel stay pre/post event. Extra nights cost calculated at negotiated group rate. |
| **EWS (Early Warning System)** | Inventory tab shows red "⚠" at ≥90% utilisation. Auto Top-Up toggle (UI) for future TBO retail block pull. |
| **Multi-Hotel Selection** | Agent sets up multiple hotel options per event. Guest picks preferred hotel in travel prefs step. |
| **One-Shot Excel Import** | Drag-and-drop CSV/XLSX. Preview dialog shows first 5 rows before confirming. Auto-matches Category → Label. |
| **QR Check-In** | Each guest has a unique QR. Ground team scans with phone camera → instant arrival mark. |
| **Walk-in Registration** | Ground team adds on-spot guests at the door. Generates booking ref + QR instantly. |
| **WhatsApp Share** | Agent copies guest link → shares via WhatsApp `wa.me/?text=...` pre-filled with invite + booking ref. |
